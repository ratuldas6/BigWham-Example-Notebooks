# BigWham-Example-Notebooks

This series of notebooks is intended to assist new users in using the BigWham library, which is a boundary element solver. Basic examples such as the Griffith crack have been solved in 2d and 3d, along with convergence test results. In each of the notebooks, the appropriate relations, differential equations and their solutions, along with references are included.

Platform-specific installation instructions for BigWham can be found at https://scythe-guanaco-17e.notion.site/9c9f9c6cd8f74e9d80a34a762b76da3b?v=3aa7a402e2de478495c0f4d021524892
